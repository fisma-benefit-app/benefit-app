## 3) How to access database with SQL Shell

You need to install latest version of PostgreSQL DBMS in your workstation via e.g. installer from official PostgreSQL website:
https://www.postgresql.org/

Our group had 17.4.2 version during development cycle.

The software is called SQL Shell in your Windows. You can activate it 
via terminal:

```
psql
```

Then you have insert credentials to access staging -database.

2) Where are credentials?

See README.md documentation from backend-credentials -repository on 
fisma-benefit-app organisation at Github.

Canonically, the credentials can be also found from Heroku.

Then move to Add-On Services section and click "Heroku Postgres" -service from the Heroku dashboard.

Lastly move from Overview to Settings -tab, move then to ADMINISTRATION -> Database Credentials section and click finally "View Credentials" -button.
