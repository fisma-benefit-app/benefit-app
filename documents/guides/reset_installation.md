- Shut down backend
- Shut down frontend
- Flush caches [caching.md](caching.md)
- Restart backend
- Restart frontend

If that doesn't help and if you're using Docker also remove everything in Docker
docker system prune -a -f --volumes 

If instead of Docker you're using a local installation of database, remove everything relating to the application and  reinitialize the database **TODO How?**
